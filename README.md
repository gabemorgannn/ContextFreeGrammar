# ContextFreeGrammar
Goal:
You will write code to parse a text file describing a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, and you will implement an algorithm that tests whether that grammar will accept a particular string. This will give you the chance to connect the theory and practice of computation, and make the material feel more concrete.

Description:
Our code is a program that parses context free grammar. Context free grammar is a 4-tuple  (V, Σ, R, S) 
V is a finite set called variables, Σ is a set disjoint from V called the terminals, R is a set of rules, with each rule being a variable and a string of variables and terminals and S is the start variable. Our code test whether a particular string can be generated by a particular grammar. In this case our code parses grammar that is converted to Chomsky-normal form (CNF). We implemented our code based off of the
